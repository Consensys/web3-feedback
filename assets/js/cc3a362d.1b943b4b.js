The methods in gnark\u2019s frontend API allow developers to do the first part, creating cryptographic circuits. In other words, gnark translates Corset\u2019s precompiled Go constraint system into a final set of \u201ccircuits\u201d, or constraints, which will ultimately produce the SNARK proof that is submitted to the L1 network. The methods in the backend API are used at runtime to consume data through the proving system created previously in the frontend, producing as a result a proof. That is, gnark accepts the \u201cexpanded\u201d trace data for each block or set of blocks from Corset, and processes it through its prepared circuits. At this point, we have what we\u2019ve been out here amongst the stars searching for: a fresh set of transactions, executed in an EVM environment, provably real and correct, ready to dispatch to the L1.
